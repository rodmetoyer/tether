Software for doing tether simulations.
This code is currently under construction. It currently can simulation a basic free-end tether in a static fluid environment.
We will update the README and the [documentation](https://rodmetoyer.github.io/tether/tether.html) when the code is a little more mature.

## Running the code
To run tether code:
1. Download/clone the repo. 
2. Open the file tetherSimDriver.m in the main folder. 
3. Run the file. This file will prompt you for what kind of simulation inputs to use (from file or by manual input).
